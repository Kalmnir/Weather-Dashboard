# Weather-Dashboard

People are travelling more and more these days for work or fun, so being able to know what weather to expect at your destination is important.
As such, I have made a useful little site that allows users to search for a city and obtain the current and 5 day forecast for that city.

##Features of the site

```
-A search window to input a city name for search.
-A display box for the searched city showing current weather conditions
-A 5 day forecast showing estimated tempurate, humidity, and windspeed for searched city.
-Saved history for searched cities that can be clicked on at any time to bring up the forecast.
-A clear button used to empty out local storage and removed searched cities.
  ```
